{"text": "<s>[INST] \nThe following is an email sent by an employee of a medical organization (ACME Medical) to an external party outside the organization. Your objective is to analyze the email to detect restricted information, if any.\n\n--Start of email--\nSubject: Urgent IT Support Needed for Patient Records System\nHi Jeff,\n\nI hope you're doing well. We've been experiencing some issues with our patient records system, and I was hoping you could help us sort it out. For some reason, certain entries aren't syncing correctly across the network, and it's affecting our workflow severely.\n\nFor instance, we've been trying to update the records for Jane Doe, but her details won't update. Her address (123 Maple Street, Springfield) should have been changed in the system after her last visit, but it's still showing her old address. Additionally, we've had similar issues with John Smith's social security number (987-65-4320). It's crucial we get these updated correctly to avoid any compliance issues.\n\nI've included part of the previous email thread below that has more details about the system errors. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and advise on a possible solution.\n\n--- Previous message ---\nHey Team,\n\nWe've noticed some discrepancies in the patient records updates. Certain fields don't seem to be reflecting the changes made by our staff. We need to ensure the integrity of our data, as it's vital for patient care.\n\nBest,\nAlice\n--- End of previous message ---\n\nThanks,\nAlice\n--End of email--\n\nRestricted information is defined as:\n* Patient's name\n* Patient's phone number\n* Patient's address\n* Patient IDs\n* Social Security Numbers\n* Patient's Medications\n* Patient's Medical Diagnosis\n\nYou should strictly use the definition of restricted information as provided. Do not refer to anything else as restricted information. 'Patients' refer to patients of the medical organization. Employees are not patients of the organization.\n\nAre there restricted information within the email?\n\nYour output should be a JSON with the following format.\n{\"explanation\": \"\", \"restricted information found in email\": {\"patient's name\": [], \"patient's phone number\":[], \"patient's address\": [], \"patient ID\": [], \"social security numbers\": [], \"patient's medications\": [],  \"patient's medical diagnosis\": []}}\n\n[/INST] {\"explanation\": \"The email contains restricted information, specifically patient's name, patient's address, and social security number. These details are explicitly shared in the email, which is a violation of patient confidentiality.\", \"restricted information found in email\": {\"patient's name\": [\"Jane Doe\", \"John Smith\"], \"patient's phone number\": [], \"patient's address\": [\"123 Maple Street, Springfield\"], \"patient ID\": [], \"social security numbers\": [\"987-65-4320\"], \"patient's medications\": [], \"patient's medical diagnosis\": []}} </s>"}
