Your objective is to analyze the email to detect restricted information, if any.\n\n--Start of email--\nSubject: Regarding Patient Information\nDear XYZ Company,\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide you with an update on the project we are working on together. The patient's name is John Smith and he is currently undergoing treatment at our facility. It is crucial that we maintain the confidentiality of his information and I wanted to ensure that you are aware of this.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nMedical Coordinator\nACME Medical Center\n123 Main Street, Anytown, USA\nPhone: 555-123-4567\n--End of email--\n\nRestricted information is defined as:\n* Patient's name\n* Patient's phone number\n* Patient's address\n* Patient IDs\n* Social Security Numbers\n* Patient's Medications\n* Patient's Medical Diagnosis\n\nYou should strictly use the definition of restricted information as provided. Do not refer to anything else as restricted information. 'Patients' refer to patients of the medical organization.

This clearly falls under the category of restricted information. However, there is no mention of the patient's phone number, address, patient ID, social security numbers, patient's medications, or medical diagnosis. Therefore, these categories are not present as restricted information in the email. The mention of the patient undergoing treatment does not provide specific medical diagnosis information and therefore is not classified as restricted under the guidelines provided.\", \"restricted information found in email\": {\"patient's name\": [\"The patient's name is John Smith\"], \"patient's phone number\": [], \"patient's address\": [], \"patient ID\": [], \"social security numbers\": [], \"patient's medications\": [], \"patient's medical diagnosis\": []}} </s>"}
